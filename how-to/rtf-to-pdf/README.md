IronPDF provides an efficient solution for converting RTF files and strings into PDF documents. This conversion process offers numerous advantages, including consistent visual appearance on various platforms, better security features, compact file size, and excellent print quality.

## Example: Converting an RTF String to a PDF Document

Leverage the `RenderRtfStringAsPdf` function to turn an RTF string directly into a PDF file. This method also supports a wide range of **RenderingOptions**, including setting [text and HTML headers and footers](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/headers-and-footers/), [image and text stamping](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/csharp-edit-pdf-complete-tutorial/#stamper-abstract-class), [page numbering](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/headers-and-footers/), and adjusting the page size and orientation. Furthermore, after your PDF is generated, you can manage the PDF's structure by [merging, splitting](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/merge-or-split-pdfs/), rotating, as well as adding [annotations](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/annotations/) and [bookmarks](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/bookmarks/) to enhance its utility and navigability.

```csharp
using IronPdf;

// Create a new renderer
ChromePdfRenderer renderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();

// Define the RTF string
string rtfString = @"{\rtf1\ansi\deff0{\fonttbl{\f0 Arial;}}{\colortbl;\red0\green0\blue0;}\cf0Here is some \b bold \b0 and \i italic \i0 text.}";

// Convert RTF string to PDF
PdfDocument pdfDocument = renderer.RenderRtfStringAsPdf(rtfString);

// Save the generated PDF
pdfDocument.SaveAs("newPdfFromRtfString.pdf");
```
