## Options for Saving PDFs

### Storing PDFs on Disk

When looking to store your PDF files on disk, utilize the [`PdfDocument.SaveAs`](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.PdfDocument.html) method. This option also offers features like password protection. For more details on digital signatures on PDFs, refer to the guide on '[Digitally Sign a PDF Document](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/signing/).'

### Saving a PDF to MemoryStream in C# (`System.IO.MemoryStream`)

The property [`IronPdf.PdfDocument.Stream`](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.PdfDocument.html) enables saving the PDF directly to memory, employing a `System.IO.MemoryStream`.

### Binary Data Storage

To save the PDF as binary data, refer to the [`IronPdf.PdfDocument.BinaryData`](https://ironpdf.com/object-reference/api/IronPdf.PdfDocument.html) property. This method returns the document as a byte array, or `byte[]` in C#.

### Web Server PDF Delivery to Browsers

For online applications, PDFs should be transmitted in binary form.

#### MVC PDF Export

```csharp
// Returns a file stream result, allowing 'stream' to be downloaded by the client.
return new FileStreamResult(stream, "application/pdf")
{
    FileDownloadName = "downloadedFile.pdf"
};
```

#### ASP.NET PDF Export

```csharp
// Access the PDF's binary data
byte[] binaryData = MyPdfDocument.BinaryData;

// Clear any existing content in the response
Response.Clear();

// Specify the type of data in the response
Response.ContentType = "application/octet-stream";

// Output the binary data to the response's stream
Context.Response.OutputStream.Write(binaryData, 0, binaryData.Length);

// Ensure the response is sent to the client
Response.Flush();
```
