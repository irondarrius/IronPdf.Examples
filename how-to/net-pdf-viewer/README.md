## Viewing a PDF in the Default System PDF Viewer

To display a PDF externally from any application, you can utilize a technique that involves `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start`. This function launches the PDF in the system's default viewer, such as a web browser or Adobe Acrobat, when available.

```csharp
using IronPdf;

// Convert any HTML snippet or full document to PDF
ChromePdfRenderer renderer = new ChromePdfRenderer();
PdfDocument pdf = renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>IronPDF Greetings</h1>");

var filePath = "GeneratedPdfDocument.pdf";

// Save the PDF file
pdf.SaveAs(filePath);

// Open the PDF using this simple method to view it with the system's default PDF viewer
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(filePath);
```

This code snippet showcases how to employ `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start` for launching a PDF with the system's default PDF viewer. Make sure the specified path in your file directs to a legitimate PDF document on your machine.

IronPDF also supports viewing PDFs in MAUI projects. Find out more by visiting: "[Viewing PDFs in MAUI for C# .NET](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/pdf-viewing/)."
