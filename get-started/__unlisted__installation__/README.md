## 1.1. Install IronPDF via NuGet

Follow these steps inside Visual Studio to include the [IronPDF NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IronPdf).

1. Right-click _References_ in Solution Explorer, then pick Manage NuGet Packages.
2. Click on Browse and type `"IronPdf"`.
3. Choose the package and proceed with installation.

```shell
/Install-Package IronPdf
```

IronPDF also offers specific NuGet Packages for [Mac](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/macos/), [Linux](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/linux/), [Azure](https://ironpdf.com/how-to/azure/), [Docker](https://ironpdf.com/get-started/ironpdf-docker/) and AWS. Refer to our [advanced NuGet installation instructions](https://ironpdf.com/get-started/advanced-installation-nuget/).

## 1.2. Install IronPDF by Direct DLL Download

Alternatively, you can manually download and configure IronPDF as follows:

1. Download the [IronPDF DLL package](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.zip) for Windows and unzip it to a folder like ~/Libs in your Solution directory.
2. Navigate to 'Dependencies' in Solution Explorer on Visual Studio, right-click, select 'Add Project Reference', then Browse and add the DLLs from the unzipped folder.

Explore IronPDF DLL zip packages for various platforms.

- [Windows](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.zip)
- [Linux](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.Linux.zip)
- [MacOS](https://ironpdf.com/packages/IronPdf.MacOs.zip)

### Implement License Key

Early in your application, typically at startup, include your license key using the following code snippet or refer to the '[License Keys Guidelines](https://ironpdf.com/get-started/license-keys/)' for alternative methods.

```csharp
IronPdf.License.LicenseKey = "YOUR-IRONPDF-LICENSE-KEY";
```

## 2. Configure Appropriate Access To Required Directories

Ensure specific users or roles have the necessary permissions for certain files and directories.

Each .NET [AppDomain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/application-domains) needs its [TempFolderPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_folder), and programs under the same [AppPool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/configuring-security/application-pool-identities) should not share a TempFolderPath.

To set the permissions:

1. Right-click a file or folder.
2. Go to Properties -> Security.
3. Click on Edit.
4. Adjust the permissions as needed.

## 3. Define the Installation Path

Deploy the necessary components for [HTML to PDF conversion](https://ironpdf.com/tutorials/html-to-pdf/). IronPDF uses Chromium safely for this operation, which is set up automatically. However, if a "failed rendering" error occurs, specify an alternate path for unpacking the browser binaries like the Temp directory.

#### Specify `IronPdf.Installation.TempFolderPath`

To set the right directory for temporary files use:

```csharp
IronPdf.Installation.TempFolderPath = @"C:\My\Safe\Path";
```

Moreover, to manage environmental variables applicable to temporary file paths for IronPDF:

```csharp
using IronPdf;

var MyTempPath = @"C:\Safe\Path\";
Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("TEMP", MyTempPath, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process);
Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable("TMP", MyTempPath, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process);

IronPdf.Installation.TempFolderPath = System.IO.Path.Combine(MyTempPath, "IronPdf");

var Renderer = new IronPdf.ChromePdfRenderer();
using var Doc = Renderer.RenderHtmlAsPdf("<h1>Html with CSS and Images</h1>");
Doc.SaveAs("example.pdf");
```

Subsequent sections continue to guide through essential settings and compatibility information including IIS, Microsoft Visual C++, Linux, Docker, Azure, AWS Lambda, and macOS integration for a seamless IronPDF implementation in your .NET applications.
