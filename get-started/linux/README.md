dnf -y install libxshmfence

# Modify permissions for IronCefSubprocess to make it executable

chmod 755 IronCefSubprocess
# Reminder: IronCefSubprocess is typically located at bin/runtimes/linux-x64/

```

## Alpine Linux Compatibility

As of the current year, Alpine Linux does not support IronPDF. This limitation arises because Alpine continues to utilize the older "musl" C libraries, which are not fully compatible with the requirements of Chromium developers needed to support the operating system.

### Deploying IronPdfEngine on Alpine with Docker in .NET 6

IronPdf offers a comprehensive Docker container that encapsulates all the functionalities of IronPdf. This setup allows applications on Alpine Linux to leverage IronPdf capabilities by linking with the IronPdfEngine Docker container.

#### Step 1: Obtain and Execute the IronPdf Engine Docker Container

Use the commands below in your terminal to retrieve and initiate the IronPdf Engine Docker container:

```shell
# Download the IronPdfEngine Docker container

docker pull ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine

# Start the IronPdfEngine Docker container

docker run -d -p 33350:33350 ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine
```

```shell
# Retrieve the Docker image for IronPdfEngine from Iron Software's official repository

docker pull ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine

# Start the IronPdfEngine in a detached container

docker run -d --publish 33350:33350 ironsoftwareofficial/ironpdfengine
```

## Step 2: Configure Your Console Application

- Begin by creating a new console application designed for .NET 6.

- Proceed to add the IronPdf.Slim package from NuGet Package Manager to your project.

For further details on the deployment and usage of [IronPdfEngine](https://ironpdf.com/get-started/ironpdfengine-docker/), consult the linked guide.

## Compatibility with Additional Linux Distributions

For Linux systems that are not officially supported, IronPDF can still be utilized by manually installing the necessary prerequisites using package managers like **apt-get**, **hfs**, and **yum**. This flexibility permits the use of IronPDF across diverse Linux environments that aren’t directly listed as supported.

If encountering issues during the initial setup, IronPDF might generate exceptions to highlight missing system dependencies.

Within your application directory, the **IronCefSubprocess** binary is crucial for operation. You may need to identify its exact location, often found within the `runtimes` or `bin` directory. Furthermore, execution of some commands might require `sudo` access to ensure proper installation and configuration.

For users working with a Linux OS not mentioned in our documentation, a practical approach involves studying the Chromium browser's dependency requirements on your specific Linux distribution.

Should you need assistance or wish to see official support extended to other Linux distros, do not hesitate to reach out to us at [support@ironsoftware.com](mailto:support@ironsoftware.com).

### Standard Dependency Configurations for Linux

For other Linux operating systems not specifically listed, you can use the standard packages mentioned earlier in the document.

```sh
# Start by updating the package list and then install the required libraries

apt update
apt install -y libc6-dev
apt install -y libgtk2.0-0
apt install -y libnss3
apt install -y libatk-bridge2.0-0
apt install -y libx11-xcb1
apt install -y libxcb-dri3-0
apt install -y libdrm-common
apt install -y libgbm1
apt install -y libasound2
apt install -y libappindicator3-1
apt install -y libxrender1
apt install -y libfontconfig1
apt install -y libxshmfence1

# Set the correct permissions for IronCefSubprocess to allow it to run

chmod 755 IronCefSubprocess
# Reminder: Typically, the IronCefSubprocess binary is located in the bin/runtimes/linux-x64 folder

```

### Diagnosing Missing Dependencies

The `ldd` utility is an effective tool for identifying missing dependencies in applications. When executing `ldd IronInterop.so`, this tool displays all required shared libraries for the application. If a library is missing, such as if you see a message like **libcef.so => not found**, it suggests that there's a vital dependency missing that could hinder the application from functioning properly. Typically, the `IronInterop.so` file can be found in the directory specific to the OS, such as **bin/Debug/net6.0/runtimes/linux-x64/native**.

```shell
# Analyzing the dependencies of IronInterop.so

ldd IronInterop.so
```

### The IronCefSubprocess Binary

The `IronCefSubprocess` is a crucial binary located within the `bin` directory of your application. It is essential for the correct functioning of the application and must have executable permissions set for the .NET process to utilize it.

```sh
# Update permission settings for IronCefSubprocess

chmod 755 /bin/runtimes/linux-64/IronCefSubprocess
```
