IronPDF excels in creating flawless PDF files from HTML and offers functionality for transforming PDF documents into HTML format. This is facilitated by the integration of the `PdfDocument` and `HtmlFormatOptions` classes, which provide essential methods for the conversion process and allow users to refine the formatting of the resulting HTML.

## Guide to Converting a PDF Document into HTML

Below, find a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to executing this task:

Step one involves initializing the conversion by loading the target PDF into IronPDF. This is done by deploying the `FromFile` method of the `PdfDocument` class, with parameters directing it to a specific file location. Consequently, a new `PdfDocument` object, `pdf`, is created, available whenever the conversion needs to be referenced.

Following the PDF's loading, we demonstrate how to transform the PDF document into a basic HTML string that can subsequently be printed on the console or altered as per the developer's requirements. Another transformative option provided is the conversion of the PDF into an HTML file, which is more suitable for detailed manipulations or distribution. The simplicity of these methods, which requires but a single line of code, enhances their convenience and practicality for developers.

For a more tailored result, the `HtmlFormatOptions` class plays a pivotal role. By utilizing its properties, developers can customize aspects such as the background color, the color and alignment of headings (H1), page margins, and more. Introducing a new instance of this class, `htmlFormat`, into the code starts this customization process.

In this scenario, we illustrate adjustments such as setting the background color to white, adjusting the heading color to blue using the `IronSoftware.Drawing.Color` class, and enlarging the H1 font to 25 pixels. Headings are centralized, and PDF page margins within the HTML are set to 10 pixels.

The process culminates with the use of the `SaveAsHtml` method, which not only converts the PDF into HTML but also allows for the inclusion of additional parameters. These include specifying the filename and location for the saved HTML document, using **fullContentWidth** set to true to utilize the full content width of the PDF, assigning a title to the HTML document, and implementing the previously set formatting specifications with `htmlFormatOptions`.
