> Full guide: [Set temp path](https://ironpdf.com/examples/set-temp-path/)

When utilizing IronPDF, the software may create temporary files while processing the generation, alteration, and rendering of PDF documents. This behavior aligns with typical operations of software applications which temporarily house data during active sessions. Crucially, IronPDF grants you comprehensive control over the creation location of this folder and other essential settings pertaining to temporary files.

## Steps to Configure Temporary File Paths in IronPDF

### Explanation:

1. **Specify a Custom Path**:
   - Begin by creating a variable `MyTempPath`, a string that specifies the directory path designated for storing temporary files. Before proceeding, confirm that this directory exists and has the necessary access permissions since IronPDF relies on this path during its operation.
2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Utilize the `Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable` method to assign the `TEMP` environment variable to our custom `MyTempPath`. This system-wide variable is pivotal for many applications, including IronPDF, to locate the directory for temporary files.
3. **Define IronPDF's Temporary Directory**:
   - Assign the `Installation.TempFolderPath` property by combining `Path.Combine` to merge "IronPdfTemp" with our custom path, thus crafting a specific subdirectory for IronPDF's temporary files.
4. **Produce a PDF**:
   - Create a `ChromePdfRenderer` instance, employed to transform HTML content into a PDF document.
   - Execute `RenderHtmlAsPdf` on said renderer with a string of HTML content to create the PDF, which is then stored in the `doc` variable.
   - The document is saved as "example.pdf" through the method `doc.SaveAs`.

By managing the temporary file paths, you enhance your ability to oversee the files produced during PDF generation, hence ensuring the seamless operation of your application without overloading the default temporary directories.
