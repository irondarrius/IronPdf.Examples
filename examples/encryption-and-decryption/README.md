IronPDF prioritizes PDF security and offers robust tools for encrypting and decrypting PDF files. This includes adding custom metadata and security settings to your PDFs. IronPDF supports 128-bit encryption, decrypting files with the correct passwords and enforcing password protection on PDF documents, both existing and new.

Starting the encryption or decryption of PDFs with IronPDF begins by either creating a PDF or loading an existing one, as shown below. When opening our PDF with `PdfDocument.FromFile`, we specify the file path and the access password.

Next, the PDF's metadata is customized, with `pdf.MetaData.Author` allowing us to set a new author name. Metadata fields are accessed via `pdf.MetaData.field-key`, enabling the addition of keywords, modification dates, or any other necessary information.

Subsequent code removes existing passwords and encryption, preparing the PDF for new security settings application. With `pdf.SecuritySettings.setting`, you can tailor the PDF’s security configuration, setting restrictions such as read-only access, annotating permissions, and print settings through the `PdfSecuritySettings` class.

Finally, `pdf.Password` sets or replaces the PDF’s password, employing strong 128-bit encryption to safeguard the document from unauthorized viewing. Once all adjustments are finalized, save the updated PDF wherever needed using `SaveAs()`.
